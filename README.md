# geolocate
Java / Spark / Swagger API example - Return geo location for an ip address informed to the api

This project is a base Java Maven Project, so for the first use all the Maven dependencies need to be updated.
The Apache Spark is the Rest API framework so for starting it is necessary to execute the main method on the class GeoLocate.

After starting the endpoint 'geolocate/{ip}' will be enabled.
This main method is also responsible to initialize the swagger-spark for the API documentation.
The swagger documentation can be accessed on the url 'localhost:55555'
